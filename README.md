Repository containing assignments for the Unsupervised Language Learning course, University of Amsterdam.

### Instructions for Lab 1:

The code for lab 1 can be found in the Lab1 folder. We separated functionality for the three main topics into three files:
1. ULL_Lab1_WordSimilarity.ipynb
2. ULL_Lab1_WordAnalogy.ipynb
3. ULL_Lab1_Clustering.ipybn

You can run the code by first setting the correct local paths to the data in the first code cell, and then run the code cell by cell.
The requirements are listed in the first cell of every notebook.
For the first two files, the tables and figures are shown in markdown cells. If you want to reproduce them, set the flag create_figures to True.
Note that especially the analogy task will take a long time to finish (~20 minutes).
